"Cannot find module serial"

-> install pyserial (pip install pyserial). Make sure that you don't have any other serial package installed because it will get angry at you if you do


"Serial Exception could not open port 'COM8'"

-> open your device manager and go to ports. Look for what Prolific PL2303GS USB Serial COM Port is labeled under
	(it should be labeled in parenthesis next to the name. Usually COM5 or COM8, but I have seen it go all over the place lol)
	Change the python code to match what COM port it is under. This change will be on line 5 of SerialRec.py
